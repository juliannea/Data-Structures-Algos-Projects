Mage.hpp declares the Mage class along with its private and public members
Project Description: This program utilizes polymorphism and inheritence to allow for the display of 
                     Character data unique to their status of being a Barbarian, Mage, Ranger, or Scoundrel. 
                     Allows for changes to private members of subclasses in response to the character eating 
                     tainted stew.
